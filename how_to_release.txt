To make a release...

1. Make changes.
2. Update dependencies with "go get -u"
3. Build
4. Commit and push changes.
5. git tag -a 0.1.0 -m "Release 0.1.0."
6. git push origin 0.1.0
7. goreleaser release --clean
8. Go to github and make the release.

If something happens and the tag is messed up, you will need to delete the
local and remote tag and release again.  To delete the tag:

1. git tag -d 1.0.9
2. git push --delete origin 1.0.9
